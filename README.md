## Requirements

Depending on the directory you are working with, you may need:

- OpenMP-enabled C/C++ compiler (e.g., `gcc` or `clang` with OpenMP support)
- CUDA Toolkit for CUDA-based implementations
- SSE-compatible processor for vectorized computations
- OpenCL SDK for OpenCL-based programs
- MPI library (e.g., OpenMPI) for distributed computing

## Compilation & Execution

Each subdirectory contains source code with its own compilation and execution instructions. Refer to the specific README or comments in each directory.
